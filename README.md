## Description 
    
*The what, why, and how:* 
      
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. In this challenge I have build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I have used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
## Usage

* In this social network API when I enter the command to invoke the application then my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
* When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.
* When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia then I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.
* When I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia then I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list.
